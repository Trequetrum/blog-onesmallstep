You'll find both programming and philosophy.\nEnjoy your stay!\n\n","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/about/","title":"About"},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/contact/":{"body":"","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/contact/","title":"Contact"},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/derive-y-comb/":{"body":"Preface\nWhy would you want to know how to derive the Y-Combinator? Well, mostly for interest's own sake.\n\nHistory: It's a common misconception that electrical computers begat — or at least motivated — study into computation, complexity analysis, universal decidability, and so on. There's a storied history of logicians delving into these topics long before anyone imagined we would be teaching silicon how to think. Curry's presentation of the fixed-point combinator for λ-Calculus (sometime in the late 1930's, I can't find a concrete source) is one of many early cornerstone results that then went on to shape the world of computing.\nCurry’s Paradox: This famous paradox shows where logic fails to model some basic properties of speech and mathematics. The Y-Combinator may be used used to surface this paradox in computational systems. Its close relation with other well known topics like the Liar's paradox, decidability, and Gödel's incompleteness theorems makes this a fun brain teaser to interact with and poses serious challenges to researches involved in the work of trying to formalize or understand the systems being modelled. On top of the emergent complexity inherent to the millions of interacting parts of a large software system, writing bug-proof software is systemically difficult too.\nRecursion: Curry's Y-Combinator is an elegant formal definition of recursion. Describing the semantics of a function call is made more complex if your language allows recursion. While the process is tedious, function calls can generally be described as an equivalent flat sequence of steps (for example; where you assign some variables and copy the body), so you can easily preserve the meaning of a program with functions within a language that doesn't have them. In the face of recursion this simple idea doesn't terminate, so you need some mechanism that lets you reify functions.\n\nPrelude\nThis blog entry attempts to create a series of small exploratory steps; the net result of which uncovers something very much like the Y-Combinator — a variadic extension, perhaps? It's not that important what we call it. We'll jump right in with Python. We're going to start with a very simple function and a contrived restriction, then keep taking little steps to abstract a bit at a time.\nWhat we're about to do is feed some of the ideas from λ-calc into a simple python program. I don't believe writing Python as λ-calc is a either a recipe for success or a very pythonic thing to do. We're treating Python more as a means to actively play around with pseudo-code than any attempt to be abidingly Pythonic. Python’s dynamic nature and relatively unobtrusive syntax make it a good language to use for this. In the off chance you want to copy some of the code and play around with it until it makes sense, this should be a fairly straight forward task.\nI also think Python's runtime semantics are intuitive to a lot of programmers. So let’s jump in!\nAn anonymous version of factorial\nOur first step is going to be to try to puzzle out how to write an anonymous recursive function. \nWithout recursion, this task is generally quite simple. Here is a function named double, to apply some value to the function we first reference it by name and apply a value (Instead of a standard Python function def, I’ve assigned a lambda expression to a variable. It just makes the transformation into an anonymous function very simple).\ndouble = lambda n: n + n\ndouble(5)\n\n10\n\nOf course, if I want to define the same function without naming it, I can do so. However, If I want to call it, I must call it in-line. Like so:\n(lambda n: n + n)(5)\n\n10\n\nWhen you do this, at first blush it looks like the re-usability of functions becomes lost to you. For instance, what if I want to know what happens when I compute double(5) + double(6)? It looks like I have to copy my anonymous function a second time.\n(lambda n: n + n)(5) + (lambda n: n + n)(6)\n\n22\n\nWhy even create a function if we can't re-use it? Fortunatly, we can rescue this situation with a little bit of work. We can paramaterize the function itself, which lets us call the parameter twice.\n(lambda double: double(5) + double(6))(lambda n: n + n)\n\n22\n\nThis is a way in which we can make sense of an expression like double(5) + double(6).\nWhy restrict ourselves to anonymous functions? Well, nearly every example of recursion you'll see performs the self-referencing step by name. By untangling this single restriction we can both arrive at a deeper understanding of recursion and derive the Y-Combinator. Rather neat, no?\nThere is a lot of content out there that starts by introducing λ-calc basics and going from there. I chose this sort of sideways approach because as far as I know it is a relatively novel way of understanding this cool bit of computing history.\nAs a formal definition of recursion λ-calc's Fix-Point Combinator doesn’t much care about how other mathematical objects like numbers or propositions are represented. I think we can get a reasonable distance toward understanding a version of the Fix-Point Combinator via the semantics of Python without worrying about  λ-terms, how variables are introduced, what makes a legal α-conversion or β-reduction, etc. I contend we don’t need any of that for what's described here.\nWhat we do need, however, is the single restriction that stops us from using Python's built in call-site resolution to perform recursion on our behalf. Once we've shown that it can be done, we'll start using names again to keep the code going forward a little cleaner and easy to understand.\n\nHere is the function I want to write anonymously:\nfactorial = lambda n: 1 if n==0 else n * factorial(n-1)\nfactorial(5)\n\n120\n\nAssuming factorial is just like double, we could just try dropping the name and calling it in-line:\n(lambda n: 1 if n==0 else n * factorial(n-1))(5)\n\nNameError: name 'factorial' is not defined\n\nOf course, this doesn't work. Since factorial referred to itself, removing the name messes with the internals of the implementation. So this is the first puzzle: how can we define factorial using this simple recursive definition without relying on some external state where factorial is already defined?\nIf you’re like me, thinking this through should break your brain a little bit. Understanding the relationship between recursion and looping is a bit more intuitive. If you write a stack to push and pop some state, you can re-write anything recursive as a loop. If you don’t have any loops and you don’t have any built-in recursion, how can you do recursion by just passing functions around?\nWhat we can do is try relying on a common programming trick. If you're ever in a position where you've removed some global value (as is sometimes good coding practise), but you want to keep a function that depends on that value, you can pass that value into the function as a parameter instead.\nUSER_PREFIX = \"User:\"\ndef select_user_repr(user):\n    return f\"{USER_PREFIX} {user.f_name} {user.l_name} ({user.age})\"\n\n# Becomes\n\ndef select_user_repr(prefix, user):\n    return f\"{prefix} {user.f_name} {user.l_name} ({user.age})\"\n\nOf course, you'll still need to define prefix somewhere before calling select_user_repr, but how you architect your software to accomplish that doesn't matter to select_user_repr anymore (which makes it a bit more readily reusable).\nSo if factorial isn’t in the global scope, maybe we can pass it in somehow instead.\n(lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(n-1))(????????, 5)\n\nSo now we have an anonymous function, but it takes a parameter that we're not sure how to fulfill. This next bit is admittedly a bit of a leap. Let’s think through what goes where the ???????? is sitting above. Remember that this is a recursive call, we want to pass in the same function that we’re calling! Can we do that?\nIf we could use names we might try something like this:\nr = lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(n-1)\nr(r,5)\n\nTypeError: &lt;lambda&gt;() missing 1 required positional argument: 'n'\n\nOh! Oh yeah, if we pass in r as f here, then we'll be required to meet the API of r. Remember that we updated r to take two arguments. We know what they are and they’re now both in scope so we can just include the new first argument.\nr = lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)\n#_____________________________________^______\nr(r,5)\n\n120\n\nThat seems to work. If you can mess around with the code so far and figure out why this worked, you’ll have managed the most difficult part of figuring out the Fix-Point Combinator.\nOf course we've named r here which wasn't supposed to be allowed. \nHowever, we're now in a better place than we were before because r doesn't depend on itself explicitly. This means the in-lining trick we used with double will work with r. We just need to copy the definition of r twice.\n# 1. r = lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)\n# 2. r(r,5)\n# Substitute r from line 1 in-place of both r in line 2\n(lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1))((lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)), 5)\n\n120\n\nIt's a bit of an eye-sore, but it works! We're going to keep going with r for now, but just remember we can expand r as shown above.\nThe parametrization above doesn’t require self-reference, just a function with the same behaviour. For example:\nr1 = lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)\nr2 = lambda f, n: n * f(f, n-1) if n!=0 else 1\nr1(r2,5)\n\n120\n\nIf you trace what’s happening here, r1 is actually only called the once. r2 is then called n-1 times until an answer is found. In a way, r1’s primary purpose here is to bootstrap r2. The part of r1 that does the bootstrapping is this: f(f, n-1). You can see how it’s calling f with itself, which we know ends up being r2 with itself. What if r1 doesn’t do any of the rest and just acts to bootstrap r2? Something like r1 = lambda f, n: f(f,n) should work? Well yes, but there’s another way to understand this.\nFactorial, auto-doubling\nWhen we look at where we've come so far, we have an anonymous function and it works but it's rather annoying to always need to pass in a second identical version of the function each time we want to call it. Instead, we'd like to have a function where we can just pass it a number and get the factorial of that number back as a result.\nThis is pretty easy, as it turns out. We'll parameterize the 5 in the snippet above into a new function and then call that with 5.\nr = lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)\n# r(r,5) &lt;-- pull out the 5 as a param ‘n’ for a new function\n(lambda n: r(r,n))(5)\n\n120\n\nSo now we have an anonymous function can call this in-line with only a number and it will evaluate to the factorial of that number. The function calls r with the correct parameters and we're off to the races again.\nWe've accomplished the first task that we set out to accomplish. We've created an anonymous version of factorial. We can call it a few times with different values and compare it against the standard non-anonymous version just to convince ourselves this really works.\n# Recursive starting function\nfactorial = lambda n: 1 if n==0 else n * factorial(n-1)\n# Anonymous rewrite\nr = lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)\n\ndef fact_test(num): \n    return factorial(num) == (lambda n: r(r,n))(num)\n\nlist(fact_test(n) for n in [5,7,10,13,20])\n\n[True, True, True, True, True]\n\nWe're just mucking about, so seeing this output is good enough for now. \nWe could stop here, this really isn't too bad. Though of note is that right now we've hand-written a wrapper for r. If we write a new recursive function, then we'll need to write another wrapper as well.\nFor example:\n#greatest common denominator\ngcd = lambda a, b: a if b % a == 0 else gcd(b % a, a)\n# Anonymous rewrite\nr = lambda f, a, b: a if b % a == 0 else f(f, b % a, a)\n\n(lambda a, b: r(r,a,b))(42, 28)\n\n14\n\nThis wrapper function isn't really doing anything special, all it does is create a new function that's lacking the first parameter of the wrapped function and then calls the wrapped function properly. The only things that change from wrapper to wrapper is how many parameters there are and which function is being wrapped. Instead of a wrapper for factorial and another wrapper for gcd. We can generate wrappers automatically for any similar recursive function expression. \nFirst, lets describe what it means to be a \"similar recursive function expression\". There are two criteria:\n\nYou must take the recursive call of the function as the first parameter.\nYou must pass forward the first parameter as the first parameter again on any recursive calls.\n\nLoosely, your function must look like this:\n# Notice that f is the first arg and that f calls itself with f as the first arg\ndef any_name(f, *any_other_args):\n    # Any code you want, probably a base case\n    # ...\n    # Recursive call\n    f(f, any_computed, values, here)\n    # Any code you want\n    # ...\n    return something\n\nWe're going to write a function mock (as a reference to the \"To Mock a Mockingbird\" puzzle book) that generates these wrappers automatically for us. This is a fairly common pattern in computer science. You might hear terms like Adapter, Decorator, or Proxy used in the Object Oriented software dev world. At its simplest, you take some functionality as input and return some functionality that wraps the input with some extra behaviour.\nConsider no_op_wrapper below. It returns a new function that acts the same (extensionally equal) as the given function. There's a level of indirection but no change in behaviour.\ndef no_op_wrapper(f): \n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    return wrapper\n\nno_op_wrapper(lambda x: x + x)(5)\n\n10\n\nmock is just like no_op_wrapper, only it adds some observable behaviour. Now the given function is applied to itself first before the call is made.\ndef mock(f): \n    def wrapper_with_f_applied(*args, **kwargs):\n        return f(f, *args, **kwargs)\n\n    return wrapper_with_f_applied\n\nYou can write this a bit more concisely using Python's lambda expressions:\nmock = lambda f: lambda *a, **kw: f(f, *a, **kw)\n\nThis lets us do the recursive wrapping trick for any recursive function expression as discussed above. Lets try it with factorial and gcd:\nmock( # Factorial\n    lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)\n)(5)\n\n120\n\nmock( # GCD\n    lambda f, a, b: a if b % a == 0 else f(f, b % a, a)\n)(42, 28)\n\n14\n\nWe got the right answers, so mock seems to be working for us.\nPre-applied Recursion\nIn every one of our recursive function expressions, the second requirement is that we're always going to need to call f with itself:\n# Factorial\nlambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)\n#_______________________________^^^______\n\n# GCD\nlambda f, a, b: a if b % a == 0 else f(f, b % a, a)\n#____________________________________^^^______\n\nThis is a small, but repetitive step. Its possible to get this step wrong and create some pretty bizarre control flow. \nIt's also a rule that should seem a bit suspicious. The first rule parametrizes f and is what lets us create a recursive call. The second rule is just an extra bit of bookkeeping. It just re-aligns the API to this new form of a function that takes itself as a first parameter. We should think about whether this is accidental or essential complexity. Consider that we've already created a function called mock that removes our need to call r with itself. There doesn't seem to be any reason (in principle) why we couldn't use mock to call f with itself too.\nReally, as a point of pride, we want this step gone. The puzzle here is: how?\nConsider the following: mock(f)(n-1) is extensionally equal to f(f, n-1).\nmock(\n    lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * mock(f)(n-1)\n)(5)\n\n120\n\nGiven that this works, the recursive expression for factorial doesn't call f directly anymore. If we could give the expression mock(f) in place of f, then we can drop the requirement that f needs to call itself as the first argument.\nWe can use the same trick where we wrap the input and return a modified version. First, lets create a wrapper around our recursive expression r that doesn't do anything yet:\nmock = lambda f: lambda *a, **kw: f(f, *a, **kw)\nr = lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(f, n-1)\n\nmock(             r      )(5)\\\n    ==                       \\\nmock(lambda f, n: r(f, n))(5)\\\n    ==                       \\\n120\n\nTrue\n\nNext, we add a modification to our wrapper:\nOf course a wrapper that does nothing isn't useful, but we can modify this slightly by altering the wrapper's f before passing it to our recursive inner function. Which will mean that factorial will no longer need to perform that step for itself. Instead of calling mock(f) as part of the implementation of r, we call mock(f) before calling r.\nmock = lambda f: lambda *a, **kw: f(f, *a, **kw)\n# Update r so it isn't passing f forward anymore\nr = lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(n-1)\n\nmock(lambda f, n: r(mock(f), n))(5)\n\n120\n\nIn doing this, we've crested the hill. \nThe expression we're wrapping no longer requires f to pass itself forward on each subsequent call. We're now in a similar position as before we wrote mock. We need to create this custom wrapper around r where we call mock(f). The solution is the same as well. We'll create a new function called fix that wraps our new type of recursive function expression.\nHere are the updated rules for our recursive function expressions:\n\nYou must take the recursive call of the function as the first parameter.\nYou must pass forward the first parameter as the first parameter again on any recursive calls.\n\nThat feels nice.\nHere's what fix looks like.\nmock = lambda f: lambda *a, **kw: f(f, *a, **kw)\n\nfix = lambda r: mock(lambda f, *a, **kw: r(mock(f), *a, **kw))\n\nLets try it out!\nfix( # Factorial\n    lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n * f(n-1)\n)(5)\n\n120\n\nfix( # GCD\n    lambda f, a, b: a if b % a == 0 else f(b % a, a)\n)(42, 28)\n\n14\n\nWhich gets us to a really nice place. Using fix, we can create any recursive function anonymously if we just include f as the first parameter and call it exactly the same way we'd make our recursive calls usually.\nfact = lambda    n: 1 if n==0 else n * fact(n-1)\n# becomes\nfix(   lambda f, n: 1 if n==0 else n *    f(n-1))\n#--------------------------------------------------------------\ngcd  = lambda    a, b: a if b % a == 0 else gcd(b % a, a)\n# becomes\nfix(   lambda f, a, b: a if b % a == 0 else   f(b % a, a))\n\nfix is the Y-Combinator\nFix is actually the Y-Combinator with some *a and **kw thrown in to allow us to define our recursive functions in a more python-familiar variadic functions style.\nSo, if the steps we took along the way didn’t throw you for a loop, you can now derive the  Y-Combinator for yourself! Exciting!\nAppendix\nLet's take our definitions, drop the *a and **kw stuff and see what it looks like. In λ-calc, doing this is very loosly akin to something called an η-reduction. In Python, this reduction isn't as straight forward. So while the code below is Python-like, don't take it too seriously. We play a bit fast a loose with the syntax here so that if you see this stuff in the wild, you may recognize it.\nThis really is the least important part of the article :)\nmock = lambda f: lambda *a, **kw: f(f, *a, **kw)\n# η-reduction (Drop extra arguments that are just passed through)\nmock = lambda f: f(f)\n# α-conversion (Rename variables)\nM = lambda x: x(x)\n\nfix = lambda r: M(lambda f, *a, **kw: r(M(f), *a, **kw))\n# η-reduction (Drop extra arguments)\nfix = lambda r: M(lambda f: r(M(f)))\n# expand the first and second M\nfix = lambda r: (lambda x: x(x))(lambda f: r(((lambda x: x(x)))(f)))\n# β reduction (Apply f to the second M)\nfix = lambda r: (lambda x: x(x))(lambda f: r(f(f)))\n# β reduction (Apply expression on the right to the first M)\nfix = lambda r: (lambda f: r(f(f)))(lambda f: r(f(f)))\n# α-conversion (Rename variables)\n# This is Y as given by Curry\nY = lambda f: (lambda x: f(x(x)))(lambda x: f(x(x)))\n\n# λ-Calc notation\nY = λf.(λx.f(xx))(λx.f(xx))\n# Or the version we need in eager evaluation languages like python to \n# force lazy execution. So this is a bit closer to the fix function we\n# derived in this article (Think of z like \"*a, **kw\")\nZ = λf.(λx.f(λz.xxz))(λx.f(λz.xxz))\n  = λf.(  λxz.xxz   )(λx.f(λz.xxz))\n\n","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/derive-y-comb/","title":"Deriving the Fix-Point Y-Combinator"},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/n-tuple-sudoku/":{"body":"Sudoku notations\nThis blog entry assumes the reader understands the rules of Sudoku.\nWhen filling in a Sudoku, you may think of each cell on the board as being either filled in or empty. As puzzles becomes more advanced, it's common for people to add notations or take notes in some way. The notations used here describe each cell in a board as all the remaining possibilities for that cell.\nConsider the following board where only a 5 in the middle is given. You can then notice that the cell's row, column, and box have all had all the 5s removed. The rest of the cells can all still have any possibility.\n \n\nBecause this is not a proper Sudoku, we've annotated everything that we can logically deduce and yet we haven't solved the puzzle. For a proper Sudoku, you can keep deducing reasons for removing possibilities from cells until each cell has only a single possibility left. Once this is done, the puzzle is solved.\nThis blog aims to explain an algorithm for removing possibilities from a Sudoku Puzzle. The technique will not solve every proper Sudoku, but it will fully solve most of the puzzles you might find in a sudoku book and can be easily combined with a brute force algorithm to solve the rest. If you look up Sudoku solving techniques online, this algorithm is a generalization of the naked and hidden pairs technique, but generalized for tuples of any size.\nWe'll discuss the technique, then explore some ways to efficiently implement the technique via bit-masking.\nVocabulary\nTalking about Sudoku requires some vocabulary for which we'd better be on the same page (pun intended).\nWe'll go through some of that here.\n\nBoard: A 9x9 (rank-3) Sudoku board is a collection of 81 cells where each cell belongs to exactly 1 row, 1 column, and 1 box.\nRank: A Sudoku of rank n is an n2×n2 square grid, subdivided into n2 boxes (each of size n×n). There are n2 options used to fill out the board.\nOption: can be represented by any symbols, though typically options are the numbers used to fill a Sudoku board. On a 9x9 board, they are elements of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\nIndex: The name for a position on the board. On a 9x9 board, the set of indices are {0..80}\nCell: An index and a set of options. The set of options for a given cell is an encoding of all the possible options that a position on a board may eventually take. If a cell contains the set {1,4,6,7,8}, that means there are constraints on the board such that any of the other options are invalid. A cell is both a position on a board and a set of options. For a 9x9 board, the cardinality (number of possible options) of a cell is between 1 and 9 (no empty set).\nForced/Solved Cell: A cell whose set of options has a cardinality of 1.\nGroup: Predefined collection of cells (row, column, or box)\n\nRow/Col/Box: Names for the 3 groups of a typical Sudoku board\nPeers: cells (specifically indices) that share a group\n\n\n\nHere is an image highlighting some of these terms:\n \n\nThe One Rule\nYou have solved a Sudoku puzzle if and only if you\n\nFill in the whole board using the set of options such that each group contains each option exactly once.\n\nOverview\nTo keep the language and examples from becoming overly verbose, I'm going to assume a rank-3 (9x9) Sudoku board throughout this explanation. There's nothing special about 9x9 Sudoku when it comes to n-tuple constraints and this approach works just as well with any rank Sudoku.\nOne of the basic approaches to solving a Sudoku puzzle is to search each group (Row, Column, or Box) without regard for the state of the rest of the board. The aim is to split a group into two distinct subgroups such that the two subgroups can safely have no options in common.\nThere are two approaches that allow you to mechanically find such subgroups. We’ll call these the Naked constraint and the Hidden constraint. \n\nIf we discover these subgroups using the Naked constraint, we'll call the subgroup discovered a Naked Tuple. The other subgroup is implicitly just the rest of the group.\nIf we discover these subgroups using the Hidden constraint, we'll call the subgroup discovered a Hidden Tuple. The other subgroup is, again, implicitly the rest of the group.\n\nI define Naked constraint and Hidden constraint below (In How do Tuples constrain a board?), but it's enlightening to first build some intuition of Naked and Hidden Tuples. Seeing how to find each tuple and understanding that the two are actually duals of one another, further simplifies the definition of these constraints.\nN-Tuple examples\nHere's an imagine that show how either a naked tuple or a hidden tuple can be used to arrive at a new board state. There's an example for singletons and for pairs.\n \n\nWhat follows is the same examples described via language:\nNaked N-Tuple described examples\n\nNaked 1-Tuple: (Singleton) There is a cell in this group that has only 1 option (the option 2). Therefore, all other cells in this group cannot contain a 2\nNaked 2-Tuple: (Pair) There are 2 cells that have only some of 2 options (2s or 3s). Therefore, all other cells in this group cannot contain a 2 or a 3.\nNaked N-Tuple: There are N cells that have only some of N options. Therefore, all other cells in this group cannot contain any of these N options\n\nHidden N-Tuple described examples\n\nHidden 1-Tuple: (Singleton) There is only 1 cell in this group that may contain a 2, therefore this cell can contain a only 2 (and no other options)\nHidden 2-Tuple: (Pair) There are only 2 cells in this group that contain either a 2 or a 3, therefore these two cells can contain only 2 or 3\nHidden N-Tuple: There are only N cells that contain any of these N options, therefore these N cells can contain only these N options\n\nHow to find a Tuple\nThis dual nature of naked and hidden pairs is at the heart of what this algorithm does. In general, we find a tuple, update the annotations on the board, then repeat.\nIs it hard to find such tuples? \nHumans are pretty quick to spot singletons and pairs, though it can be difficult to see larger tuples. The process of finding a tuple can be seen as set operations on fairly small sets, and fairly small sets can be presented as binary numbers. Computers can perform these checks extremely efficiently. More impressive is that the time it takes to find a singleton is the same as the time it takes to discover any of the larger tuples (Though we'll see why we prefer smaller tuples regardless when we discuss optimizations)\n \n\nThere are a few set-operations you need to understand before you can start finding tuples.\n\n\nCardinality: A measure of the number of elements of the set. For example, if α is {1,2,4,6,7,9}, then the cardinality of α is six — |α| == 6. The cardinality of the empty set is zero — |{}| == 0.\n\n\nSuperset: A set of options α is a superset of another set β if every option in β is also an option in α. So the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} is a superset of every other possible set of options. The set {8} is only a superset of {8} and {} (the empty set). Since cells cannot have a cardinality of zero, that means {8} is only a superset of cells that are solved with the option 8. \n\nUse this to find naked tuples\n\n\n\nNot Disjoint: If the intersection of two sets is inhabited, then they are not disjoint. The intersection of two sets is just the set of elements they have in common. {5,6,7,8,9} and {1,3,5,7,9} are not disjoint because they have this intersection: {5,7,9}. {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} are disjoint because their intersection is empty {}.\n\nUse this to find hidden tuples\n\n\n\nHow to find a Naked N-Tuple.\nYou might find a naked tuple if you:\n\nPick any set of options (They have some cardinality of size n) \nPick any group on the board. \nIf the set you picked is a superset of exactly n cells in that group, then those n cells form a Naked N-Tuple.\n\nYou will find every naked tuple if you do this for:\n\nEvery combination of options that form a set (of which there are 511)\nEvery group (of which there are 27) \n\nHow to find a Hidden N-Tuple\nYou might find a hidden tuple if you:\n\nPick any set of options (They have some cardinality of size n) \nPick any group on the board. \nIf the set you picked is not disjoint with exactly n cells in that group, then those n cells form a Naked N-Tuple in that group.\n\nYou will find every hidden tuple if you do this for:\n\nEvery combination of options that form a set (of which there are 511)\nEvery group (of which there are 27) \n\nWhat do Naked and Hidden N-Tuples have in common?\nWhen describing how to find a Hidden or Naked Tuple, the process is nearly identical. Intuitively you can use the same algorithm to find both. Moreover, if you look for both at the same time, you don't have to repeat steps 1 and 2 from above.\nThere is a much stronger relationship between these two constraints. For any value of N, every Naked N Tuple has a corresponding Hidden (9-N) Tuple and vice versa.\nFor example: the following []s contain a group. Each cell is just an index paired with a set of options (These indices happen to be from a box in the board.)\n \n\n[ (0  { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n, (1  {   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n, (2  {   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n, (9  {   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n, (10 {   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n, (11 {   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n, (18 {   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n, (19 {   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n, (20 {   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 })\n]\n\n\nThe set {1} with cardinality 1 is not disjoint with exactly 1 cell in this group (The cell with index 0). \nTherefore: this cell is a hidden 1-tuple in this group. \n\nIf that's so, what is the corresponding naked 8-tuple? Well: \n\nThe set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with cardinality 8 is a superset of exactly 8 cells in this group (The cells with indices 1,2,9,10,11,18,19,20).\nTherefore: these cells are a Naked 8-Tuple in this group.\n\n(A moment's reflection with show that...) This pattern holds for every Hidden and Naked Tuple. Hidden Tuples are the dual of naked Tuples. \nIf every Naked Tuple has a corresponding Hidden Tuple and vice versa, do we need both?\nStrictly speaking, no. They represent the same constraints on the board.\nBut: when designing an algorithm smaller tuples are better. This is for a few reasons.\n\nIf you look for small tuples first, you can narrow the search space while looking for larger tuples. For example: if the cells (2 {3,4}) &amp; (8 {3,4}) are a 2-Tuple, then no other n-tuples of size 2, 3, 4, etc in the same group need to search the indices 2 or 8 nor the options 3 or 4. This doesn't work in reverse. Consider if cells (2 {3}) &amp; (8 {3,4}) are a 2-Tuple, we still want to find the naked 1-tuple (2 {3}) since it would represent a constraint that removes the 3 from (8 {3,4}).\nTuples can exist in more than one group at a time. If we find a 1-tuple in the first row, this is guaranteed to also be a 1-tuple in a column and a box (Every index has exactly 1 row, 1 column, and 1 box). In a 9x9 board, n-tuples of size 1 always have 3 groups, while n-tuples of size 2 and 3 may have up to 2 groups. Smaller tuples are better because they can be constraints for and narrow the search space in multiple groups at once.\nIf you look for both Hidden and Naked tuples at once, you can stop looking after you've searched for n-tuples of size 4. Hidden Tuples of sizes 1 to 4 correspond to Naked Tuples of sizes 9 to 5 and vice versa (Naked Tuples of sizes 1 to 4 correspond to Hidden Tuples of sizes 9 to 5)\n\nHow Tuples Constrain a Board\nAn N-Tuple is a set of options with cardinality n, paired with a list of indices of length n.\nEach N-Tuple constrains the board in 2 ways:\n\nNaked  Constraint: Constrain the cells at each index to be a subset of the set of options.\nHidden Constraint: Constrain the peers of this n-Tuple to be disjoint with the set of options.\n\nIn either case, you remove the minimal number of elements possible such that this constraint is met.\nThe peers of an n-tuple:\n\nThe peers of a cell are all the other cells that share a group with it. Remember that each cell is part of three groups.\nThe peers of a list of cells are the cells that share a group with with every cell in the list. A tuple must share at least 1 group. The cells with index 0 and 12 have no peers can therefore never be a valid 2-tuple.\n\nNotice the symmetry here:\n\nWe find a Naked Tuple by discovering that the first constraint is satisfied and therefore can enforce the second constraint on the board.\nWe find a Hidden Tuple by discovering that the second constraint is satisfied and therefore can enforce the first constraint n the board.\n\nSo while each tuple can enforce both constraints, only one of the constraints will ever change the cells on the board. One of the two constraints will already have been met.\nRepresenting Data\nRepresenting a Cell\nA fast a simple way to encode the set of options for a cell is as an integer bit-field. In the binary representation, each digit represents a true/false value for the question (is n an element of this cell's set).\n000000000 is the empty set {} \n000000001 is the set {1} \n000000010 is the set {2} \n000000100 is the set {3} \n000000111 is the set {1,2,3} \n101010101 is the set {1,3,5,7,9} \n111111111 is the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} \n\nRepresenting a board\nA board can be represented by the unconstrained options for each cell.

That's one iteration of the algorithm. If you've generated any actions that have updated the board state, then you can run a second iteration of this algorithm on the new board. Aside: In this project, hiddenTuples and nakedTuples are strategies that each describe one iteration and untilStable can re-run any strategy until it doesn't update the board anymore.\nThe algorithm iterates through possible cells (for board-size of 9, this is integers between 1 and 511), and gets board indices of the group that have a notDisjoint or isSuperset relationship with this cell\nExamples from the group shown above:\nIntegers in these arrays correspond to indices in the board.\nIn this example, cell 000000001 is:\n\nnotDisjoint with the cells at indices 0 and 1\nA superset of a cell at index 0\n\n  unit = select [0,1,2,9,10,11,18,19,20] sudokuBoard\n  {----- For Reference ---------\n         [ 000000001 -- 0\n         , 101010101 -- 1 \n         , 000100010 -- 2\n         , 000111000 -- 9\n         , 010000000 -- 10\n         , 000110000 -- 11\n         , 000110000 -- 18\n         , 000110000 -- 19\n         , 000110000 -- 20\n         ] \n  ------------------------------} \n  [ {cell: 000000001, notDisjoint: [0,1] superset: [0] }\n  , {cell: 000000010, notDisjoint: [2] superset: [] }\n  , {cell: 000000011, notDisjoint: [0,1,2] superset: [0] }\n  , {cell: 000000100, notDisjoint: [1] superset: [] }\n  , {cell: 000000101, notDisjoint: [0,1] superset: [0] }\n  , ...\n  , {cell: 111111110, notDisjoint: [1,2,9,10,11,18,19,20] superset: [2,9,10,11,18,19,20] }\n  , {cell: 111111111, notDisjoint: [0,1,2,9,10,11,18,19,20] superset: [0,1,2,9,10,11,18,19,20] }\n  ]\n\nHere is how we mechanically decide whether we have found a Naked/Hidden N Tuple:\nsize notDisjoint = length notDisjoint\nsize superset = length superset\nsize cell = ... -- number of 1s in binary representation of cell\n\nif size cell == size superset) then -- this is a naked tuple\nif ... &gt;= ... superset) then -- I'm not interested \nif ... &lt; ... superset) then -- this board is not valid\n\nif size cell == size notDisjoint) then -- this is a hidden tuple\nif ... &gt; ... notDisjoint) then -- this board is not valid\nif ... &lt;= ... notDisjoint) then -- I'm not interested\n\nEach tuple found can generate actions that update the board state.\nGenerating Actions for Naked Tuples:\nFor all indices that have a naked tuple, drop that option in all other indices for the unit \nExample Naked 1-Tuple:\n  000000001 = superset: [0]\n  complement 000000001 = 111111110\n\nGenerated Actions: \n\nindices of interest is the difference between indices in the unit and indices that superset found \nindices of interest = [0,1,2,9,10,11,18,19,20] \\ [0] == [1,2,9,10,11,18,19,20]\n\n  board[1] = 101010101 AND 111111110 = 101010100\n  board[2] = 000100010 AND 111111110 = 000100010\n  board[9] = 000111000 AND 111111110 = 000111000\n  ...\n  board[20] = 000110000 AND 111111110 = 000110000\n\nGeneralized:\n  board[n] = board[n] AND (complement cell)\n  where\n  n is an index of interest\n  cell is the possible combination of options that generated n\n\nGenerating Actions for Hidden Tuples:\nFor all indices that have a hidden tuple, drop all other options at those indices \nExample Hidden 1-Tuple:\n  000000010 = notDisjoint: [2]\n\nGenerated Actions: \n\nindices of interest are the indices that notDisjoint found \nindices of interest = [2]\n\n  board[2] = 000100010 AND 000000010 = 000000010\n\nGeneralized:\n  board[n] = board[n] AND cell\n  where\n  n is an index of interest\n  cell is the possible combination of options that generated n\n\nStandardizing Actions\nActions above were described as mutations to the board.\nIf we treat board as some global state, this is how we might wright action in Javascript.\n  function action(index, cell){ \n    board[index] = board[index] AND cell\n  }\n\nThe take-away is that two integers (index &amp; cell) are enough to encode any action described above. \nWe can use types to describe an action like this is purescript:\n  newtype Index = Index Int\n  newtype Cell = Cell Int\n  type Action = Tuple Index Cell\n\nAlgorithm optimizations\nChecking a rank-3 board for every possible naked or hidden tuple requires 248,346 (511 * 27 * 9 * 2) bitwise operations. On most modern CPUs, that takes a few microseconds (I measured this at 62μs). At such small numbers, the cost of computing tuples will be dwarfed by the cost of cash misses while reading from and writing to memory. I found that implementing optimizations in PureScript offered immediate benefits, but trying the same thing with my Rust implementaion was trickier. My guess for why (Without digging into the generated assembly) is that any optimization that might invalidate cash locality is a problem.\nSo while there arguments to be made about premature optimizations, here are some things you can notice about this algorithm that may lead to optimizations if done carefully (and bench-marked, etc). Earlier, when we said smaller tuples where better, these are optimizations that witnesses that.\nShrink the search-space\nRemember when we iterated through all possible sets of options (integers 1 to 511)? The naive implementation is to iterate through them using their natural ordering under integers. \nYeah, don't do that. Instead, order this by the cardinality of the sets. (Remember that the cardinality of a set is the number of 1s in its binary representation.)\nFor a board of size 9, that looks like this:\n1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20, 24, 33, 34, 36, 40, 48, 65, 66, 68, 72, 80, 96, 129, 130, 132, 136, 144, 160, 192, 257, 258, 260, 264, 272, 288, 320, 384, [...etc, etc], 255, 383, 447, 479, 495, 503, 507, 509, 510, 511\nIt's easier to spot the cardinality of each set of options if the same sequence is written in binary:\n000000001, 000000010, 000000100, 000001000, 000010000, 000100000, 001000000, 010000000, 100000000, 000000011, 000000101, 000000110, 000001001, 000001010, 000001100, 000010001, 000010010, 000010100, 000011000, 000100001, 000100010, 000100100, 000101000, 000110000, 001000001, 001000010, 001000100, 001001000, 001010000, 001100000, 010000001, 010000010, 010000100, 010001000, 010010000, 010100000, 011000000, 100000001, 100000010, 100000100, 100001000, 100010000, 100100000, 101000000, 110000000, [...etc, etc], 011111111, 101111111, 110111111, 111011111, 111101111, 111110111, 111111011, 111111101, 111111110, 111111111\nNow searching for Tuples starts with the smallest sets of options and progresses to larger ones. Because of this ordering, if a tuple is found:\n\nOptions within the tuple can be ignored when searching for more tuples (Fewer possible sets of options to iterate through)\nIndices containing the tuple can be ignored when searching for more tuples (Fewer indices to check for tuples)\nSets of options with size larger than the size of the remaining indices can be ignored\n\nSince possible sets of options are ordered by size, the above can be implemented via an early return\n\n\n\nFree Naked N-Tuples\nYou can also get some Naked Tuples for free while running the either Tuple algorithm\nFor example:\n\nIf a row finds a hidden 2 Tuple and both indices are in the same box\nThen those two indices describe a Naked 2 Tuple for the box.\nIf you don't take the Free Naked 2 Tuple described in this example, The next iteration will discover it as a Hidden 7 Tuple. Duplicating the work being done.\n\nIn general, if the indices of an N-Tuple from one unit are all peers in any other unit, then they are a Naked N Tuple in that other unit.\n","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/n-tuple-sudoku/","title":"N-Tuple Sudoku Constraints Algorithm"},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/pages/","title":""},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/posts/":{"body":"","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/posts/","title":"posts"},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/privacy/":{"body":"Privacy\n\nThis site does not set or use cookies.\nThis site does not store data in the browser to be shared, sent, or sold to third-parties.\nNo personal information is shared, sent, or sold to third-parties.\n\nEffective Date: 1st March 2023\n","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/privacy/","title":"Privacy Policy"},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/rxjs-stopwatch/":{"body":"Stopwatch\nPreamble:\nBack in the spring of 2020, I ran face first into the stack overflow equivalent to the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon. I answered a stack overflow question about creating a stopwatch using RxJS and found myself referring back to variations on that exact question every few weeks throughout the summer. I'm putting it here now because it seems intuitively like a task that a streaming library should be able to handle easily. I have never found an answer that clicked for me. Perhaps somebody else will discover or point me at a clever solution that I hadn't considered.\nI think RxJS streams push-based nature make them a poor fit for the problem. \nI'm also including it because I think it has some pedagogical merit for a beginner looking to sharpen their skills a bit.\n\nIt uses defer to capture state in a closure\n\nEach subscription creates it's own local state\nOperators like retry behave as expected\n\n\nIt uses scan to incrementally build data\n\nreduce, scan, and expand are friendly operators that are often overlooked\n\n\nIt uses a higher order operator — switchMap — to manage observable lifetimes\n\nMastering mergeMap, switchMap, concatMap, and ExhaustMap is nessesary to be proficent with Reactive Extensions\n\n\nIt builds a custom RxJS Operator\n\nUnderstanding how to create an OperatorFunction generally means heading toward an understanding a whole host of interesting concepts that RxJS uses liberally. These include currying, function composition, reducers (aka: fold, accumulate), and finally transducers (composable higher-order reducers).\n\n\n\nThe Problem\nThe crux of the problem is this: \n\nOur input is a stream that emits a series of \"RUN/PAUSE\" or \"RESET\" actions over an arbitrary span of time.\nIf the input stream errors or completes, then so should the output. \n\nOnce the output is done, all memory should be released to the GC — for example, there should be no ongoing timers.\n\n\nThe watch has two states:\n\nRunning: The output should emit a number every interval milliseconds.\nPaused: There should be no output.\n\n\nThe watch starts Paused and switches state each time the source emits \"RUN/PAUSE\"\nThe Output's emissions are numbers:\n\nThe first number to be emitted is a zero\nIf the source emits \"RESET\", the next number emitted is a zero\nOtherwise, the emitted number is always the previous emitted number + 1.\n\n\n\nThe most accurate solutions just use the system time. Doing so can avoid the sharp corners of the JS event loop. I think that for the sake of just learning and using RxJS, those concerns add incidental complexity. To that end, there's a relatively succinct solution you can implement by recursively calling setTimeout. For a third party auditing such code, understanding the mix of callbacks, setTimeout(), clearTimeout(), timestamp calculations and so on would not be trivial. We're hoping RxJS can modularize the logic such that a reader familiar with the library could reasonably understand it on a first or second reading. There shouldn't be too much logic that needs to be understood in the context of the broader solution, so that if you understand each part you naturally come to an understanding of the whole.\nA Solution\nHere is a solution which leans on RxJS' switchMap operator to manage an internal stopwatch timer. We also use scan to track the watches current state for us. In general, the solution is short enough that it's pretty straight forward.\nWhat I don't like abotu this solution is how count is managed. It breaks up an otherwise very modularized solution. The value is initialized, incremented, and reset to zero all on disparate lines of code. The only way to understand what is happening with this value is to understand the entire solution. Which is a shame because everything else can be understood a few lines at a time. It's a fairly contained little piece of state and it seems like the natural way to manage this. On the other hand, defer adds a bunch of clutter and exists only to add in a little bit of state. It simply feels like there should be a clean solution that doesn't mutate anything.\nThe solutions I've thought up that don't mutate state end up being messier to an extent which I don't think makes it worth it. For example, I don't think it's worth doing something like using a long running interval/timer/system-time and remembering pauses via an offset.\ntype StopwatchAction = 'RUN/PAUSE' | 'RESET';\n\nfunction createStopwatch_static(\n  control$: Observable&lt;StopwatchAction&gt;,\n  interval: number\n): Observable&lt;number&gt; {\n  return defer(() =&gt; {\n    let count = 0;\n\n    return control$.pipe(\n      scan(\n        ({ running }, action) =&gt;\n          action == 'RUN/PAUSE'\n            ? { running: !running, reset: false }\n            : { running, reset: true },\n        { running: false, reset: false }\n      ),\n      concatWith(of({ running: false, reset: false })),\n      tap(({ reset }) =&gt; { if (reset) count = 0; }),\n      switchMap(({ running }) =&gt;\n        running ? timer(0, interval).pipe(map((_) =&gt; count++)) : EMPTY\n      )\n    );\n  });\n}\n\n// Create an OperatorFunction that can be used in an RxJS pipe\nfunction createStopwatch(\n  interval = 1000\n): OperatorFunction&lt;StopwatchAction, number&gt; {\n  return control$ =&gt; createStopwatch_static(control$, interval);\n}\n\nStopWatch in Use\nControl a stopwatch with DOM events to set fields on the DOM.\n// The user clicking buttons in the UI creates the input stream\nmerge(\n  fromEvent(startBtn, 'click').pipe(map((_) =&gt; 'RUN/PAUSE' as const)),\n  fromEvent(resetBtn, 'click').pipe(map((_) =&gt; 'RESET' as const))\n).pipe(\n  // Operator function turns StopwatchActions into numbers\n  // The default interval is a second, so we don't set it\n  createStopwatch()\n  // If the stopwatch emits an error, re-create the stopwatch\n  retry()\n).subscribe(seconds =&gt; {\n  // Edit the DOM to display the current seconds\n  secondsField.innerHTML = seconds % 60;\n  minuitesField.innerHTML = Math.floor(seconds / 60) % 60;\n  hoursField.innerHTML = Math.floor(seconds / 3600);\n});\n\n","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/rxjs-stopwatch/","title":"An RxJS Stopwatch Implementation"},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/tts-hanabi/":{"body":"Preface\nRoughly a year ago, I wrote a scripted Hanabi Mod for Tabletop Simulation. Here is the link. This is a bit of a retrospective on that experience. I talk about Lua, Tabletop's Scripting API, and a bit about my journey programming with them.\nFirst, Some Thoughts About Lua\nLua is a fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language. It was designed for configuration and small automation scripts, though you really can't ignore that it's been one of the de-facto scripting language for games for decades now. Titans like World of Warcraft, Minecraft, &amp; Roblox all use Lua as their scripting language to develop mods.\nLua is Small\nBoth physically:\n\nThe source contains around 30000 lines of C. Under 64-bit Linux, the Lua interpreter built with all standard Lua libraries takes 281K and the Lua library takes 468K. \n\nLua: About (link)\n\n\nAnd conceptually: I felt like I had a grasp of both the language and it's standard library in an afternoon. Of course, as such things go, sometimes it feels like there's always a little more to learn. Lua does still have all the depth, nuance, and eccentricities of a general purpose programming language.\nLua is Simple\nIt offers relatively few abstractions and those that it does offer must be used explicitly.\nAs an example, consider JavaScript wherein you have named functions, anonymous functions, and arrow functions as well as important details about what a function's context/receiver is (What gets bound to the this keyword) depending on which type of function you're dealing with.\nIn Lua, you have only anonymous functions full stop. (though you can get back a method-style syntax with the colon operator :).\nAs is standard for dynamically typed languages, Lua offers a small set of types and no means to define your own. Lua has — for the most part — leaned into this simplicity and avoided building any complex object/class/type hierarchies (though the option is there via matatables and metamethods). \nConsider Lua's array-hashmap mashup type — tables:\n\nTables are the main (in fact, the only) data structuring mechanism in Lua, and a powerful one. We use tables to represent ordinary arrays, symbol tables, sets, records, queues, and other data structures, in a simple, uniform, and efficient way. Lua uses tables to represent packages as well.\n\nProgramming in Lua (link)\n\n\nLua is Mature\nBecause Lua been around since 1993, the community and resources for the language are fairly large. To me, its friendly and enthusiastic community is a major selling point for the language. \nLua isn't without its pain-points. Default global scoping, strange table length semantics, no unicode support, limited pattern matching support, and unfortunate return statement semantics are just some of the baggage Lua carries today.\nThat being said, considering its design goals, speed, simplicity, and the ease with which it can be embedded as a scripting/plugin language, Lua has done just about everything right. I have enjoyed the simplicity and consistency of the language.\nProgramming for Tabletop Simulator\nOne way to think about Tabletop Simulator (TTS) is as a light-weight game engine, allowing you to build scenes filled with 3D assets and interact with them. Most of the game development primitives are present, though they're typically incredibly simplified and geared toward the physics/tabletop experience. \nIt's fun. The immediate feedback is welcome and enjoyable when things are working. You don't need to understand any of the finer details of game development to get started. If you want to run a few little scripts here and there, react to certain inputs in simple ways, then the process of doing so with TTS is simple. \nHowever, if you want to build anything reasonably complex, you can do so but TTS either doesn't doesn't offer much help or even gets in your way. Without the active, friendly discord community around modding TTS, I would not have bothered to finish the Hanabi Mod. There are a lot of interactions at play for which the documentation is generally silent: \"If you know, you know, otherwise good luck.\"\nHere are a few examples that I remember perplexing me at the time: \n\nIf I want to display a custom UI image floating perpendicularly (at a 90° angle) above a card, I need to multiply the z-axis by a bunch since the custom card object comes pre-compressed on that axis. This works but causes pixelation which you can correct for by stretching your image in Photoshop instead.\nCertain properties of an object are accessible only via their XML/data table so you can't take the recommended route of spawning a custom Object and then provide the custom content for it after spawning it by calling setCustomObject() (As an aside, be sure to wait for the physics engine to fully spawn the object before trying to update it). Instead you must prepare an object data table representation which you can derive from another object by calling getData() on it, and manipulating the resulting table.\nThere are a thousand and one ways for globally unique identifiers — GUIDs — to become out of sync with your script's expectations during development. So either be unerringly careful or create a less brittle mechanism by which to identify your game objects.\n\nThis is especially true if you try to do anything like automate updates/settup/testing for your mod while developing.\nI used a combination of naming conventions and asset filesystem locations. Then Git can track changes and the scripts are robust against asset updates so long as filenames stay consistent. Not a perfect solution, but a quick one.\n\n\nThe Table Object is subject to a whole host of unwritten rules, but if you just delete it and use some other custom asset as a stand-in for your table, that all becomes significantly easier to manage.\n\nFor example, getting the Table to display a custom image with the right proportions was so frustrating that I eventually put it on a board with the right size, removed interactivity, and floated the board just so to make it look like the table.\n\n\n\nand so on and so on... the list is long, though it becomes manageable as you keep writing and working with it. The best advice I can give here is to get on forums or discord and ask questions.\nMy Experience Programming Hanabi\nFor me, creating a scripted Hanabi with Tabletop Simulator (TTS) + Lua was fun from a gaming perspective but a relatively joyless development experience. \nTTS doesn't provide the sort of immediate feedback loop that a scripting language like Lua thrives with. There's a tension between the game-settup, table-building, drag &amp; drop nature of TTS and its scripting. Often this means that testing some interaction requires you to reload your scripts and then perform some in-game action — spawn, move, click, deal, ect. Tabletop comes with a lot of tools designed so that many typical board game systems are effectively \"pre-scripted\". This is nice though as your begin creating custom scripts you find yourself needing to work around many of he quirks of these systems.\nMissing Static Types\nThis one is mostly a matter of preference.\nI'm accustomed to programming alongside a type checker. Programming well with a dynamic language requires a certain skill/focus that I'm not well practised with. Without a type system to keep me in check, I'm capable of creating a mess rather quickly.\nMy development style for this game was very exploratory. When I started, I wasn't really sure what features I wanted and how they would fit together. At first this seems like a good fit for a dynamically typed language like Lua, but the result is that too much time ends up being spent hunting down refactoring bugs leaving less time to experiment with system interactions.\n\nIn a language like Haskell you can re-architect a system. If you've separated out your domain logic (which is where Haskell's purity excels), by the time you've satisfied the compiler there's a gloriously compelling chance everything works as expected the first time you run the refactored program.\n\nIf you're not sure your idea for how to re-architect your system will even work, this is slow as the \"test the happy path first, then worry about making it robust later\" style of programming is more difficult. \nIf you have a clear vision for how your update/new feature will work, a little extra effort removes most of the technical debt associated with a new feature or refactor. \n\n\nIn a language like C# (another common game-dev plugin language), you'll have to hunt down a few bugs as the type system so often doesn't know the difference between a total and partial function. There's also bound to be some edge cases around ordering of effects you hadn't considered in your refactoring.\n\nIt's easy enough to use dynamic variables to more or less ignore the type system when prototyping, though this creates a different kind of technical debt. Post-hoc typing can be difficult as types often encode cross-cutting concerns that may require you to reorganize code to keep your types cleaner/manageable. \n\n\nWith Lua, you're better off performing a re-write than trying to refactor for anything as intrusive as re-architecting your system. This can be abated with a good testing suit, but TTS makes writing such a thing extremely laborious if not outright untenable (This isn't Lua's fault, of course). Many of the bugs I caught while play-testing with friends where introduced because of a seemingly harmless refactoring rather than some ill-considered business logic.\n\nProgress comes in leaps and bounds. The temptation to simply spaghetti-code your way across the finish line is pretty high.\n\n\n\nWhen I'm in programming mode, I'm somehow able to hold large chunks of a program in my mind. However, the moment I context switch away and come back some time later, I find it difficult to re-create the same mind-state. To combat this issue, I work to keep my game logic localized. To the best of my ability, I try to rely on the idea that any block of code which has no hidden dependency is a boon to the continued development or future maintenance of my software.\nWhen it makes sense, attaching scripts to physical in-game objects that can encapsulate and manage their own state is nice. To some degree, this is a simplified version of the standard Object Oriented game-dev design you encounter making games with Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc:\n\nHanabi's score-display is a good example of an isolated system like this.\nIn general, it seems like game systems don't cleanly attach to in-game scene entities\n\nThe TTS event handlers allow for local reasoning as well. With events, you can view game interactions as messages between systems. If you keep messages themselves immutable, you can maintain a clean separation between systems. Unfortunately, event handlers are fairly limited. This is because the TTS scripting API treats almost everything — Players, Objects, and their properties — as global mutable state. Lua's impoverished type system means it's up to the developer to first understand and then forever remember all the interactions at play. The choices made by TTS are orthogonal to the design of Lua, but the fact remains that Lua doesn't offer any tooling to correct course.\nLua's Coroutines\nHere's the thing... In hindsight, I should have stuck with Lua's coroutines. \nWhen I first toyed around with them, I didn't like the pattern by which you convert TTS's callback-style API into one that smoothly interoperated with Coroutines. By the time I'd seen that this could be done quite nicely, I'd already taken another route and was no longer interested in the size of a refactor that switching back would require.\nHere's my solution. A function that flattens nested callbacks:\nfunction bindCallback(callback_thunk, bind_fn)\n    return function(callback)\n        callback_thunk(function(...)\n            local thunk = bind_fn(...)\n            if thunk ~= nil and type(thunk) == \"function\" then\n                thunk(callback)\n            end\n        end)\n    end\nend\n\nThe general principle here is that you can compose APIs that use callbacks. This means instead of ending up with a deeply nested callback-hell situation (for which old-school JavaScript is so famous), you'll only ever need to be nested at most one level deep. The bindCallback function effectively separates everything into \"what came before\" and \"what comes next\". You could think of it as a lightweight multi-valued promise in a single function. In that sense, this would act a bit like a promises .then method.\nThis made wrapping the TTS callback API super simple, though on the other hand:\n\nUsing this function isn't always the most ergonomic. \nHiding control flow isn't a common Lua idiom, so it might hinder collaboration (for this project: not a big deal)\nThis doesn't have a great API for early returns or errors. This doesn't pair that well with TTS's abounding global mutable state\nThe simplicity of this approach makes it feel like a half-measure between creating a Reactive Extensions style transducer or using Lua's idiomatic and fairly powerful coroutines.\n\nGlobal UI\nHanabi's Global UI system is the stand-out feature of the Mod. It has a custom view for each player and allows players to give hints that interact directly with the cards in player's hands.\nTTS allows you to build a retained GUI using XML and then to update it dynamically based on events in game. I quickly realized that attempting to model the UI this way would be error prone. For one, each user's state must stay synchronized regardless of the state that the game is saved or loaded from. Also, TTS doesn't save any changes made to the UI’s XML between play sessions. \nI used an MVU architecture (Elm-style Model View Update) to simplify the process. This was, I think, one of the big successes of the project as I rarely found myself hunting down bizarre GUI bugs. The amount of game-state to manage for Hanabi is fairly contained, so MVU's monolithic nature isn't a downside.\nFinal Thoughts\nBuilding Hanabi was fun, though by the time it was ready, many of my friends weren’t playing much TTS anymore. I felt the project was a good intro to some game development concepts. It was also nice to produce a software artifact that non-programmers could understand and enjoy.\n","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/tts-hanabi/","title":"Writing a Hanabi Mod for Tabletop Simulator"},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/what-is-a-type/":{"body":"This is the first in a series of loosely related posts exploring Types, Type Theory, Type Systems, and some related content from the point of view of a computer scientist. The general idea is to provide a 10000 foot view of what I've been learning on the topic that may inspire me (or others) to remember and learn more. \nPreface\nSoooooooo... what is a type?\nThe question this blog post is trying to answer can feel rather nebulous. The problem is that in programming languages, types wear many hats. Function overloading lets you create control flow based on types, deriving mechanisms let you generate code based on types, IDEs provide some of their tooling based on type definitions, and so forth.\nMy plan here is to dance around the topic a bit. I want to talk about the basic types most programmers are familiar with — for example, integers. I also want to motivate future discussions in other posts about types that are a bit more abstract. For example, types that construct other types, or types that form a mathematical structure called a semiring — which among other things let you use algebra to get nice things for free.\nOne of the things I've hoped to avoid doing here is to mystify types (I'm not sure whether I've succeeded). While types seem to get at the fundamentals of what abstraction is about, they're also very natural. Assembly programmers have been using types since before we developed syntax for them or automated ways to enforce/check them. What I'm trying to dance around here really shouldn't invalidate anything about the types you are already familiar with. Nobody has lied to you about Booleans or Strings, they continue to be what you've always known. \nWe're going to start with what I undertand the general pragmatic view of types to be, then I'm going to detour us into some super basic Propositional Logic and hopefully come full circle into a very vague understanding of types and how we might change our view on what it means to annotate a program with them.\nThe Pragmatic View of Types in Computer Science\n\n[A] computer is unable to discriminate between for example a memory address and an instruction code, or between a character, an integer, or a floating-point number, because it makes no intrinsic distinction between any of the possible values that a sequence of bits might mean\n[...]\nAssigning a data type, termed typing, gives meaning to a sequence of bits such as a value in memory\n\nWikipedia (link)\n\n\nConsider the following sequence of bits:\n10000001\n\nWhat could this sequence of bits represent as a value?\n\nIf that's an unsigned 8bit integer, then it could represent a 129.\nIt also could represent any constant transformation of an 8bit integer:\n\nAbsolute negative value: -129\nThousands: 129,000\nEven numbers: 258\n\n\nIf that's a signed 8bit integer:\n\nIt could represent a -1\nIf it is in 2s complement then -127\n\n\nIf the bit that carries the sign isn't the standard one, there's a whole other set of numbers this could represent.\nIt could be an array of two unsigned 4bit integers: [8,1]\nThe value may not be an integer at all. Getting more outlandish, it might be a bit-map for items in an adventurer's backpack. In which case this might encode two specific key items (item-id 0 and 7) out of eight key items an adventurer will need to find during their quest! \nThis value could be a memory address on a very small embedded system, or perhaps the system pads this with zeros to interpret it as a memory address.\nThis could be a machine instruction code of some sort.\nThis could be a path through a binary tree.\nThe above considerations also depend on the \"endianness\" of the memory layout as well.\n\nYou can see the problem. You cannot tell the type of this value by inspecting its bits. Giving those bits a type is the process by which we imbue them with meaning. It doesn't matter that assembly has no means to annotate types and no automated way to check them, any programmer using assembly must do that work manually — they can not reasonably choose to avoid it. For example: it's never desirable to multiply two memory addresses together, so an assembly programmer does their best to avoid doing so. Failing in this task isn't a type error within the language, but it is still a type error conceptually and will result in an incorrect program.\nProgrammers need to reason about the types of the data they are working with in order to ensure that their programs are correct.\nA more abstract view of types\nThe pragmatic view of types really bundles up the idea of capturing how data is represented. This is not typically how types act while programming. Consider how often a developer even sees the sequence of bits that represent the values they use. Especially in the basic nominal cases, developers leave the bit-fiddling to low-level operations. It really doeasn't matter if a -5 looks like 1000 0101 or 1111 1011, so long as the operations (like addition and so on) work as expected.\nIn general, programmers consider even the most fundamental types to have an existential representation. A well behaved representation exists (because it must), but any other well behaved representation would do just as well. The type system forms an abstraction boundary so that so long as the API of an int doesn't change, the representation is largely irrelevant [1].\nInstead of \"giving meaning\" to a sequence of bits, types can be seen in some ways as the opposite. They describe a program that's provably generic over the representation, which means a Java Class doesn't describe a program, but instead a whole set of programs (at least one program for each possible representation of int). It just so happens we pick binary representations that work well with our hardware.\nIn some languages there are pragmatic reasons (say performance/memory) to care about the representation or some part of the representation. Because of its pedigree as a systems language, Rust has 12 different integer types, though they differ on whether they are signed (support negative integers) and how much memory they require, they don't differ on any other representational decisions such as which bit is the most significant, which bit is signed, or whether signed numbers are in two's complement. Even here, the types act to abstract exactly those choices developers want to stop caring about.\nType Systems share some Similarities with Proof Systems\nSo if it's not really about giving sequences of bits meaning, is there a different way to look at types?\nWhile tackling this topic, I'm hoping that you have some (perhaps partially forgotten) introductory-level knowledge of formal logic. If you’re like me, you may have encountered some propositional logic in your Grade 11 Discrete Mathematics course, or perhaps a few years later in undergraduate philosophy. I'm not going to lean on it in any in-depth way in this blog, but its a nice building block for understanding type systems and in turn, types.\nWhile I don't want to turn this is an introduction to propositional logic, lets take a quick moment to refresh our memories on the two ways you can show that A ∧ B entails B ∧ A in propositional logic.\nSemantic Entailment\nThe first way you can show that A ∧ B entails B ∧ A in propositional logic is via a semantic proof. You've probably seen these done via tables (often called \"truth tables\") like so:\n\n  \n    A\n    B\n    A ∧ B\n    B ∧ A\n  \n  \n    T\n    T\n    T\n    T\n  \n  \n    T\n    F\n    F\n    F\n  \n  \n    F\n    T\n    F\n    F\n  \n  \n    F\n    F\n    F\n    F\n  \n\nImplicit in this table is the meaning of A and the meaning of B. To make this explicit, they denote something called a proposition. Semantically, propositions are these objects that can be either T or F (Sometimes read as \"true\" and \"false\" respectively). T and F don't appear anywhere when we discuss the syntax of propositional logic, they only appear when we ask something like \"what does A mean?\"\nWe say that A ∧ B ⊨ B ∧ A because when we ask what A ∧ B, and B ∧ A means, in every instance where A ∧ B is T, B ∧ A is also T (More generally, we can understand ⊨ here as a relationship between specific rows and columns on a truth table). This is pretty easy in this case because we can exhaustively look at every possibility: All four of them!\nMaybe you think the answer to a question like \"what does A mean?\" should be something like \"A stands for 'grass is green'\". In philosophy, it's common to pick linguistic propositions that we can interpret some truth value for instead of picking T or F directly. Either 'it is raining' or not. Because our interpretations are blind to the difference between A and 'grass is green', we're avoiding linguistic tricks like A stands for \"this proposition is false\" or A stands for \"Not A\" by dint of interpreting only symbols and logical connectives.\n\nSo it turns out that in propositional logic specifically, you can always discover whether A ⊨ B by building a truth table. Building these tables quickly gets tiresome and other logics don’t can’t be exhaustively searched this way, so there’s another way to show this entailment. \nProof System Entailment\nThe second way you can prove that that A ∧ B entails B ∧ A in propositional logic is via its proof system. \nI'm not going to go over proof rules. I'm assuming that even if you've forgotten the specifics, you remember generally how they were used. Instead, I'll ask you to notice that we don't contend with T or F at all while using a proof system. This is because the end-game of a proof system is to cleverly pick rules that only let you assume something to denote T or to write something that must denote T. If you somehow convincingly manage the feat of picking your rules this way, you can magically know what your truth table looks like for every relevant line.\n\n  \n     Line # \n     Proof Line \n     Proof rule that makes this line legal \n  \n     1. \n     A ∧ B \n     Assumption \n  \n  \n     2. \n     A \n     ∧ elimination on line 1 \n  \n  \n     3. \n     B \n     ∧ elimination on line 1 \n  \n  \n     4. \n     B ∧ A \n     ∧ introduction on line 3 and line 2 \n  \n\nWe say that A ∧ B ⊢ B ∧ A because we have a proof system where if we assume A ∧ B, there exists some number of legal lines after which we can legally write B ∧ A. We can understand ⊢ as a purely syntactic game because we never need to reference T, or F, or tables or any such thing. This becomes an interesting game to us because we've designed it so that it can only generate propositions for which ⊨ also holds. We have a term for this relationship. Having this property where A ⊢ B entails A ⊨ B makes a proof system sound. (Perhaps less interestingly; for propositional logic it is also the case that A ⊨ B entails A ⊢ B, which makes propositional logic’s proof system complete). \nPropositional Proofs in General\nIn propositional logic, the proof system approach is often a much more concise way to show an entailment. For example, A ∧ B ∧ C ∧ D ∧ E ⊨ B ∧ C ∧ D ∧ E ∧ A takes a 32-line truth table, while A ∧ B ∧ C ∧ D ∧ E ⊢ B ∧ C ∧ D ∧ E ∧ A takes a 4-line proof (It’s a twin to the 4-line proof from above where B ∧ C ∧ D ∧ E replaces B).\nThe other cool property of a proof system is that as long as we agree to the same rules, anybody can check a proof and confirm that the rules have been followed. The idea that \"there's no special intuition required, anybody can mechanistically check the rules\" is what ends up making proofs written in a proof system machine checkable. You can write a program that can check the correctness of any proof.\nSo even in logics where you cannot \"write out the truth table,\" and for which there's no way to know when to stop searching for a proof... at least you can rest assured that if you ever do find a proof, you and others can certainly verify that the proof is correct.\nType Systems\nSo what does all this propositional logic have to do with Type Systems and with Types? \nWell, type systems and proof systems have a lot of similar properties. They both have a clean separation of syntax and semantics, they both offer a purely syntactic set of rules, that anybody (even a program) can check. They both value the relationship between ⊢ and ⊨ so that the rules for what you can do syntactically translate well into the semantics (Few programming languages actually boast a properly sound type system, though they do still value making the distinction as clear as possible).\nWhere the proof system above is just there to enforce tautologies, type systems exist to enforce abstractions. Specifically to do so in a machine tractable way. What does that even mean? \nIt sort of hard to go into detail without picking a specific type system, but we're going to pivit first. Lets get back to propositions so we can talk about about Types themselves.\nWhat are Propositions in Propositional Logic?\nWe're going to keep coming back to the mathematical substrate I was familiar with before types. It's how I started to build intuitions on the topic, but more importantly for this blog the idea that types and propositions are related is a deeply researched topic. We'll benefit from scratching the surface a bit. I'd like to take a quick detour into what a proposition is because talking about the meaning of things which themselves might denote meaning is more difficult than it first appears.\nSo when I open my undergrad textbook, the definition of a proposition in propositional logic is as follows:\n\nA proposition is a statement that can be either true or false; it must be one or the other, and it cannot be both.\n\nTo help buttress this definition, I may give some examples of statements which are or are not propositions.\nThe following are propositions:\n\nThe reactor is on.\nThe wing-flaps are up.\nJohn Major is prime minister.\n\nwhereas the following are not:\n\nAre you going out somewhere?\n2 + 3\n\nThis definition leans on a lot of other definitions and intuitions that don't actually surface in propositional logic at all. For starters, you'd be excused for thinking propositions are linguistic expressions, but philosophically the English sentence \"Snow is white\" denotes the same proposition as the German sentence \"Schnee ist weiß\" even though the two sentences are not the same. A more nuanced definition may say something about propositions being \"the sort of thing that declarative sentences denote\".\nThis is all rather abstract and you can write a PhD Thesis on how linguistic expressions do/have embedded and deviate from formal logic. That sends us down the wrong rabbit whole for our purposes. Really, propositions in propositional logic are the building blocks of a sort of syntactic game that gets interesting and applicable once you imbue it with meaning.\nSyntactically, there are a set of base propositions. For example the elements of {P, Q, R} are propositions because we've defined them to be. Then there are a small set of logical connectives and rules for how they're to be used to juxtapose propositions. So the elements of {¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔} are logical connectives. I won't spell out the rules for how to determine a well-formed formula. For example: P → Q, P → ¬Q, and P ∨ ¬P are all well formed but P Q ∧, P ∧ ∧ Q, and ¬∧P are all not well formed. Then we perform the neat trick of saying that any well formed formula is definitionally a proposition.\nSo assuming you learned the rules for a well-formed formula and you're armed with a set potentially infinite base propositions, you can simply say that propositional logic propositions are exactly these things. In a sense you can stop here. There are infinitely many of them, but you can create and verify every possible proposition and that's the end of it. You've answered the question: \"What are Propositions in Propositional Logic?\" as best as it can be answered.\nWhat comes next, the \"giving them meaning\" part can be done in any number of ways. Most of the semantics we could give this system serve no purpose. For example, I can get outright silly with it and say something like \"all propositions denote my left pinky finger\". I make the syntactic game above somewhat silly because no matter how I puzzle together big complex propositions, all they'll ever do is denote my left pinky finger. That's not helpful.\nSo instead, let me quote Wikipedia:\n\npropositions are often modeled as functions which map a possible world to a truth value. For instance, the proposition that the sky is blue can be modeled as a function which would return the truth value T if given the actual world as input, but would return F if given some alternate world where the sky is green. \n\nWikipedia (link)\n\n\nSuch functions deterministically tell us how to interpret any proposition as T or F. If they interpret the logical connectives properly, they imbue the entire enterprise with a structured meaning that is interesting by design.\nTwo quick notes on the side:\n\n\nIf you view T as the singleton set and F as the empty set, you can see the standard set theoretic semantics of propositional logic as a generalization of this semantic interpretation of predicate logic. So you can define the logical connectives above using truth tables (in the style I used earlier) or you can define them as set operations like unions, intersections and such. The approaches are the same (up to isomorphism).\n\n\nI'm writting a post which models the semantics of propositions in Lambda Calculus using JavaScript you can easily run in your browser. I'll link it here. It's a completely useless excersize for day-to-day programming, but it completely amazed me and I hope it does the same for you.\n\n\nAbout Types\nTypes are a syntactic tool for abstraction and can be talked about purely as a way to add structure to the question of whether some piece of syntax is well formed.\nTypically a type theory will have a few base types and then a few type-forming rules. Then types are straightforwardly defined as the (potentially infinite) hierarchy of types that can be generated. This is defining types by just looking at the syntactic game that creates them — seem familiar?.\nSo really, what's the point of the syntactic type game loosely described above? Types as they're discussed in the more advanced type theory circles have a direct categorical semantics. As friend of mine jokingly says, \"category theory is general abstract nonsense\" (based on how prominent representatives of the mathematical community reacted to its introduction), so we're going to shy away from that for the moment.\nA way to model the semantics of types of a simple type theory is as sets of values. To quote:\n\n\"Types” denote nonempty sets of values; they are used to restrict the scope of variables, control the formation of expressions, and classify expressions by their values. \n\nWilliam M. Farmer (link)\n\n\nWhen you open a Java Class file and see:\nint a = 5;\n\nor a Rust file and see:\nlet a: i32 = 5;\n\nint and i32 are types and in this case and both denote a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. The variable a is restricted in scope to exactly one of int's 232 (or 4294967296) possible inhabitants. There's some loose notion under which a denotes an element of int as though int is a set. If I had written int a = 5.3, I would have received a compilation error saying the expression is not well typed. The error would say something to the effect there's no meaningful way to assign a floating point number to a variable meant to hold an integer.\nType systems and type theories use types as a syntactic tool for abstraction, but they don't need to be so embedded to be useful. Consider Hungarian notation, which is an identifier naming convention that prefaces variable names with their data type. For example, the b prefacing bBusy denotes a boolean and nSize is an integer. This was popularized in a language called BCPL because BCPL has no data types other than the machine word, nothing in the language itself helps a programmer remember variables' types. \nOther untyped languages hold such information in the comments or through other conventions. It's important to note that just like assembly or BCPL still have types in the margins, typed languages also continue that trend. Developers can and do use the type integer as a bit-field or the type string as tags to approximate a disjoint union. Just consider that you can write a Haskell program that only uses values of type SequenceOfBits (allowing a wrapper around the std library) to create most any program you'd like, though I imagine you'd have a hard time doing so without making many many many mistakes along the way.\nAt their core, types seem like a very simple, but frustratingly abstract thing. They have a somewhat liminal nature, existing in many forms directly in syntax — where rules inductively define well typed syntax — and also in the meta-language — where we leave it as an exercise to the reader to understand why some expressible syntax is not necessarily meaningful.\nFor example, Rust's type system infers every variable below to be an i32. If I were writing a chair-based library for millions of developers to use, I would probably employ Rust's type system to ensure such code never compiles. If I'm writing a quick script, I may just stick with i32 and be careful about what I write.\nlet chair_colour = 15761536; // #F08080 HTML standard Hex colour code\nlet chair_height = 458; // millimetres\n\n// The following is almost certainly a bug\nlet syntactically_legal_nonsense = chair_colour + chair_height;\n\nA More Nuanced View on Types\nTo develop a nuanced view of what types you need to understand them in the context of how and why they're used. What motivates the use of types? When we look at the ways in which they're used in older imperative programming languages, a simple answer might be \"so that the compiler can calculate how much memory some data takes and how to represent (persist) the data in memory so that I don't have to do it myself\". To support this line of reasoning, these languages always give you a way to build more complex types from simpler types. Lets run with an example, most languages allow you to define a new product type called a pair from any other two types: ∀ A:type B:type | (A, B):type. This reads \"The pairing of any two types is itself a type\". A use for this is that the compiler can understand how a type can be represented based on its construction. How a pair is persisted in memory depends on the types in question, but you can describe what to do generically. For each way you can build up more complex types (like ∀ A:type | [A]:type, or ∀ A:type | Vec&lt;A&gt;:type), you can equip the compiler with rules that let it understand what to do. So the compilor contains something akin to a function from types to memory layout, but just like you can create new proposition using the logical connectives, you can create new types using some given connectives.\nIt turns out that we want the rules for how to persist a type in memory to have some predictable mathimatical structure. Like if we want to let the compilor optimise memory layouts, we need to feed it rules for how types can be re-written. Why should we allow the following re-write:\nPoint {\n  x: Int,\n  y: Int\n}\nGameNode {\n  tag: String,\n  parent: Point,\n  pos: Point\n}\n\nto\nGameNode {\n  tag: String,\n  parent_x: Int,\n  parent_y: Int,\n  pos_x: Int,\n  pos_y: Int\n}\n\nor even\nGameNode (String, Int, Int, Int, Int)\n\nThere's a deeper structure here, because just like predicates and propositions become useful in the context of a logic that declares how they can be juxtaposed with various operators (syntax) and a model for how to evaluate any legal syntax to it's meaning (semantics). Types become useful in the context of a theory that declares how they can be juxtaposed with various operators (syntax) and a model for how to evaluate any legal syntax to it's meaning (semantics). You're abstracting something more interesting than \"memory layout\" when you build types and let the compiler figure out the rest. You're actually annotating your program with a system that has a structure you can hijack for your own means to enforce program-wide properties. \nI don't think the following is necessary to develop a deeper understanding of types, but if you've taken a course or done some reading on first-order logic, then I recommend perusing this paper (link). It's a paper that hopes to recommend teaching a simplified type theory to undergrads. Assuming you have a bit of background with first-order logic, the paper is very accessible. A highlight is where it shows that although simple type theory has none of the propositional connectives or quantifiers, they can all be easily defined in simple type theory using function application, function abstraction, and equality. I'll let the paper speak for itself, but to me the power of Simple Type Theory is that is has a very uniform syntax, but hidden within a hierarchy of types is the full power of higher-order predicate logic.\nThe theory presented in the paper is type theory boiled down to its essence. It is convenient for study, but it is not highly practical for use. This is where extensions to the theory and macro-expansions and such pick up the slack.\nIn Conclusion\nThe thing to consider then, is that when a computer scientist is using Int to label a variable, they can be seen as abstracting away the representation of an Int's value as a series of bits, or as annotating their program with something akin to a logic. What's been done when annotating a variable with an Int is very simple, but as you build complex types from simpler types and construct tuples, lists, sets, etc you're building up more complex logical expressions that let you abstract away the representation of increasingly complex data. You can use function abstraction to view programs themselves as sequences of bits that need abstracting. This lets a developer create boundaries across which the way in which entire parts of your program are represented is abstracted.\nIn functional programming languages with relatively expressive type systems, it's very common to see the sorts of choices made in imperative languages being encoded as types instead. That way instead of writing out if, else if, else statements, you generate a value of some type and by cleverly encoding how these types are allowed to be composed, you're on you way to ensuring certain bad sequences of choices (now types) are not possible to create without a type error. Carefully crafting and letting a type system enforce such invariants for you matters more as software size, number of developers, and magnitude of maintenance increases.\nAt a minimum you're adding a logic system that sits on-top of your program and describes some part of it (for example: Java, C#, TypeScript, Go, etc). At the extreme end, you've realized the depths of the Curry–Howard Correspondence and you're a developer writing executable math proofs (for example: Idris, Agda, Coq, Lean, etc).\n","id":"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/what-is-a-type/","title":"What's a Type?"}},"docInfo":{"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/about/":{"body":33,"title":0},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/contact/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/derive-y-comb/":{"body":2084,"title":5},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/n-tuple-sudoku/":{"body":2478,"title":5},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/privacy/":{"body":26,"title":2},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/rxjs-stopwatch/":{"body":546,"title":3},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/tts-hanabi/":{"body":1379,"title":5},"https://trequetrum.github.io/blog-onesmallstep/what-is-a-type/":{"body":2501,"title":2}},"length":11},"lang":"English"};
